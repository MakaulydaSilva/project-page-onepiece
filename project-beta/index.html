                    unintentionally eating
                    a Devil Fruit. With his pirate crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy explores the Grand Line in search
                    of the
                    deceased King of the Pirates Gol D. Roger's ultimate treasure known as the "One Piece" in order to
