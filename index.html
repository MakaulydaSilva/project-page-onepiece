            <h2>Brief Summary</h2>

            <p class="brief-summary">
                One Piece is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. It has been serialized in
                Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 1997, with its individual chapters
                compiled into 103 volumes as of August 2022. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D.
                Luffy, a boy whose body gained the properties of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit. With
                his pirate crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy explores the Grand Line in search of the deceased King of
                the Pirates Gol D. Roger's ultimate treasure known as the "One Piece" in order to become the next King
                of the Pirates. <br>
                The manga spawned a media franchise, having been adapted into a festival film produced by Production
                I.G, and an anime series produced by Toei Animation, which began broadcasting in Japan in 1999.
                Additionally, Toei has developed fourteen animated feature films, one original video animation, and
                thirteen television specials. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising and media,
                such as a trading card game and numerous video games. The manga series was licensed for an English
                language release in North America and the United Kingdom by Viz Media and in Australia by Madman
                Entertainment. The anime series was licensed by 4Kids Entertainment for an English-language release in
                North America in 2004, before the license was dropped and subsequently acquired by Funimation in 2007.

                One Piece has received praise for its storytelling, art, characterization, and humor. It has received
                many awards and is ranked by critics, reviewers, and readers as one of the best manga of all time.
                Several volumes of the manga have broken publishing records, including the highest initial print run of
                any book in Japan. In 2015 and 2022, One Piece set the Guinness World Record for "the most copies
                published for the same comic book series by a single author". It was the best-selling manga for eleven
                consecutive years from 2008 to 2018, and is the only manga that had an initial print of volumes of above
                3 million continuously for more than 10 years, as well as the only that had achieved more than 1 million
                copies sold in all of its over 100 published tankōbon volumes. One Piece is the only manga whose volumes
                have ranked first every year in Oricon's weekly comic chart existence since 2008.
                <br>
                As of August 2022, One Piece had over 516.5 million copies in circulation in 61 countries and regions
                worldwide, making it the best-selling manga series in history, and the best-selling comic series printed
                in book volume. It is also one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.
