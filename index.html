            One Piece is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. The story follows the
            adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body gained the properties of rubber after unintentionally eating
            a Devil Fruit. With his pirate crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy explores the Grand Line in search of the
            deceased King of the Pirates Gol D. Roger's ultimate treasure known as the "One Piece" in order to become
            the next King of the Pirates.

            volumes of the manga have broken publishing records, including the highest initial print run of any book in
            Japan. In 2015 and 2022, One Piece set the Guinness World Record for "the most copies published for the same
            comic book series by a single author".
