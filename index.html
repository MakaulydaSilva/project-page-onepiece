            adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body gained the properties of rubber after unintentionally eating
            a Devil Fruit. With his pirate crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy explores the Grand Line in search of the
            deceased King of the Pirates Gol D. Roger's ultimate treasure known as the "One Piece" in order to become
            the next King of the Pirates.

                    Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as "Straw Hat", is the main
                    protagonist of the manga and anime, One Piece. He is the founder and captain of the increasingly
                    infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well as one of its top fighters.He desires to find the
                    legendary treasure left behind by the late Gol D. Roger and thereby become the Pirate King, which
                    would help facilitate an unknown dream of his that he has told only to his brothers and crew.
                    He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Born in Foosha Village, Luffy is the son of Monkey D. Dragon, the leader of the Revolutionary Army,
                    and the grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp, and their family carries the initial and Will of
                    D.Luffy met "Red-Haired" Shanks, who gave Luffy the very straw hat that has become Luffy's signature
                    accessory, having gifted it to the boy as part of a promise for them to meet again someday after he
                    became a great pirate. Growing up on Dawn Island, Luffy befriended and became sworn brothers of the
                    late "Fire Fist" Portgas D. Ace and Revolutionary Chief-of-Staff Sabo, as well as being raised under
                    the care of Curly Dadan.

                    Luffy accidentally ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi at age 7, which turned his body into rubber. Thanks to
                    his strong imagination, Luffy is able to wield the seemingly unthreatening abilities of his Devil
                    Fruit to act as an incredibly competent fighter, often manipulating his own rubbery body into a
                    variety of powerful forms. He is one of few individuals known to have awakened his Devil Fruit,
                    which bestows him with mythical power. In addition to his Devil Fruit abilities, Luffy is one of few
                    individuals capable of wielding all three forms of Haki and has mastered them to the point that he
                    has developed advanced abilities.
