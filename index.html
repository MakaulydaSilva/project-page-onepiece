            adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body gained the properties of rubber after unintentionally eating
            a Devil Fruit. With his pirate crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy explores the Grand Line in search of the
            deceased King of the Pirates Gol D. Roger's ultimate treasure known as the "One Piece" in order to become
            the next King of the Pirates.

                    Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as "Straw Hat", is the main
                    protagonist of the manga and anime, One Piece. He is the founder and captain of the increasingly
                    infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well as one of its top fighters.He desires to find the
                    legendary treasure left behind by the late Gol D. Roger and thereby become the Pirate King, which
                    would help facilitate an unknown dream of his that he has told only to his brothers and crew.
                    He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Born in Foosha Village, Luffy is the son of Monkey D. Dragon, the leader of the Revolutionary Army,
                    and the grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp, and their family carries the initial and Will of
                    D.Luffy met "Red-Haired" Shanks, who gave Luffy the very straw hat that has become Luffy's signature
                    accessory, having gifted it to the boy as part of a promise for them to meet again someday after he
                    became a great pirate. Growing up on Dawn Island, Luffy befriended and became sworn brothers of the
                    late "Fire Fist" Portgas D. Ace and Revolutionary Chief-of-Staff Sabo, as well as being raised under
                    the care of Curly Dadan.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Luffy accidentally ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi at age 7, which turned his body into rubber. Thanks to
                    his strong imagination, Luffy is able to wield the seemingly unthreatening abilities of his Devil
                    Fruit to act as an incredibly competent fighter, often manipulating his own rubbery body into a
                    variety of powerful forms. He is one of few individuals known to have awakened his Devil Fruit,
                    which bestows him with mythical power. In addition to his Devil Fruit abilities, Luffy is one of few
                    individuals capable of wielding all three forms of Haki and has mastered them to the point that he
                    has developed advanced abilities.

                    archaeologist of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.
                    She is the seventh member of the crew and the sixth to join, doing so at the end of the Arabasta
                    Arc. She temporarily left the crew during the Water 7 Arc but rejoined during the Enies Lobby Arc.

                <p>
                    Robin ate the Hana Hana no Mi at a young age, giving her the power to reproduce her body parts (or
                    her entire body) on any surface at will. As the sole survivor of the destroyed West Blue island
                    Ohara, she is currently one of only two people in the world known to have the ability to read and
                    decipher Poneglyphs, a skill which is considered forbidden and threatening to the World Government.
                </p>

                <p>
                    She acted as the vice president of Baroque Works as "Miss All Sunday", serving and partnering
                    herself directly with the organization's president; the ex-Warlord: Crocodile, who operated under
                    the codename "Mr. 0". She was a secondary antagonist of the Arabasta Saga, before joining the Straw
                    Hats. Her dream is to find the Rio Poneglyph which tells the true history of the world, specifically
                    the Void Century.

                    eventually learned to tap deeper into the powers of his Devil Fruit, giving him significant control

                    Born "Cutty Flam", he chose to go by his nickname of "Franky" until eventually permanently
                    discarding his true name per the request of Iceburg to hide his identity. Originally from the South
                    Blue, Franky was abandoned by his family as a four-year-old eventually making his way to Water 7.
                    There, he came to be a member of Tom's Workers, until an incident resulted in his body being heavily
                    damaged and requiring him to augment himself into a cyborg. Upon returning to Water 7, he became the

                    of their original captain, Tiger. He eventually became one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, though
                    he resigned during the Summit War of Marineford.

                    Royal Family. Luffy thereafter invited him to join the Straw Hat Pirates, but Jinbe held it off
                    until severing ties with Big Mom during the Whole Cake Island Arc. After staying behind in Totto
                    Land to protect the Sun Pirates from Big Mom's wrath, Jinbe returned to the Straw Hats during the

        <p>
            Devil Fruits are mysterious, distinctive fruits scattered throughout the world, known for permanently
            granting their eaters superhuman powers and an equally permanent inability to swim. With only one notable
            exception, an individual can only acquire the powers of a single Devil Fruit and survive.

        <p>
            As a whole, Devil Fruits encompass hundreds of different powers, from the (apparently) mundane to the
            inherently mass-destructive. These fruits are broadly grouped into three classes: Zoan, which allows a user
            to transform into an animal as well as an animal hybrid; Logia, which grants a user the power to create,
            control, and transform their body into a natural element; and Paramecia, which offers any of a vast array of
            strange abilities that do not fit into the other two categories.
        </p>

        <p>
            Devil Fruits have empowered many of the world's most significant individuals, especially among the Three
            Great Powers. This, along with their general rarity, causes them to be highly sought-after; single specimens
            may be valued at hundreds of millions in Belly, and extensive efforts have been made to mass-produce
            artificial versions for warfare.

        <h3 class="title-list-fruits">
            Paramecia
        </h3>

        <p>
            The most common of the three Devil Fruit types, Paramecia-type Devil Fruits grant their users any one of a
            wide variety of superhuman powers; these powers include things like shock wave generation and locking onto
            targets. Paramecia Fruits can alter features of the user's body, granting them a slippery physique, a body
            of blades, or the ability to split their own body into pieces harmlessly. Some Paramecia Fruits allow the
            user to modify the people, objects, and environment around them by making things levitate or turning people
            into toys. Finally, some fruits exist that allow users to generate and manipulate substances, like wax or
            poison.
        </p>

        <p>
            The defining characteristic of Paramecia fruits is that the abilities they grant are anything other than the
            ability to transform into animals or change their body into natural elements like the fruits of the other
            two categories.

            Zoan
        </h3>

        <p>
            The users of Zoan-type Devil Fruits gain the ability to transform into a specific animal, as well as
            transform into a hybrid form that combines attributes of their own species and the species the fruit allows
            them to transform into. Unlike other Devil Fruits, Zoan-type fruits are said to have a will of their own. A
            recently discovered science allows Zoan Fruits to be integrated into inanimate objects, bringing the object
            to life and granting it the standard Zoan transformations.
        </p>

        <p>
            Zoan fruits greatly enhance the users physical abilities and are the best kind of power for augmenting melee
            combat. Carnivorous animal Zoans are better suited for combat due to their predatory attributes. Some Zoan
            even grant special abilities based on the animal, such as the king cobra Zoan allowing the user to spit
            globs of poison, or the mole Zoan allowing the user to dig through the earth, even through solid stone, at
            high speed.
        </p>

        <p>
            Aside from most Zoans that transform their users into animals that currently exist, there are three known
            sub-classifications:

                    extinct species, such as dinosaurs.
                    Ancient Zoans are rare, and they appear to be stronger than regular Zoans. Some have even displayed
                    atypical physical abilities that their users claim the real animals naturally possess.

                    special powers, like a phoenix Zoan being able to generate flames that have healing powers. Mythical
                    Zoans are the rarest type of Devil Fruit, even more so than Logias.</p>

                    addition to not gaining animal traits and losing the ability to swim, were stripped of the ability
                    to express negative emotions, leaving them only able to smile and laugh, regardless of how they
                    actually feel. These artificial Devil Fruits, known as SMILEs, were developed by Caesar Clown and

                SMILEs are artificial Zoan Devil Fruits created with SAD. They were formerly manufactured by Donquixote
                Doflamingo and Caesar Clown and were monopolized and consumed by the members of the Beasts Pirates,
                which created the classifications of the Gifters, Pleasures, and Waiters within the crew.
                <br>
                SMILEs do not have individual names like the standard Devil Fruits, and are instead referred to as
                "(Animal species) no SMILE". In the English subtitles, they are referred to as "(Animal species) SMILE".

                The Inu Inu no Mi, Model: Okuchi no Makami is a Mythical Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allows the user to transform into a hybrid and full version of an ancient wolf deity at will. It was accidentally eaten by Yamato.
                <br>
                As noted by Kaidou, said wolf is the "Guardian Deity of Wano", making this Zoan particularly valuable. Its power was first hinted at during Yamato's confrontation with the Armored Division when Yamato briefly flashed his fangs, before its power was properly introduced in Yamato's later fight with Kaidou on the Skull Dome's roof.

        <p>
            The rarest and most powerful of the three Devil Fruit types, Logia-type Devil Fruits allow their users to create, control, and transform their body into a natural element, such as sand, mud, smoke, lightning, plant life, and even darkness. There are also Logias that can transform the user into artificial elements like paper or candy syrup, but these are considered non-canon.
        </p>

        <p>
            The elemental transformation effectively makes the user intangible, as well as allowing the user to remain in control of their body, even when it is broken into pieces. They also gain every ability related to that element, such as sand being able to absorb moisture or light being able to travel at light speed. The darkness element and its power of all consuming absorption has the unique ability to nullify any other Devil Fruit power upon contact with the user. Some Logia Devil Fruits even grant the user an infinite amount of space inside their elemental body.
