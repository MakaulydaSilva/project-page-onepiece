                        "Iron Man" Franky is the shipwright of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of
                        the
                        Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is the crew's eighth member and the seventh to join, doing so at the
                        end
                        of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc. Born "Cutty Flam", he chose to go by his nickname of "Franky" until
                        eventually permanently
                        discarding his true name per the request of Iceburg to hide his identity. Originally from the
                        South
                        Blue, Franky was abandoned by his family as a four-year-old eventually making his way to Water
                        7.
                        There, he came to be a member of Tom's Workers, until an incident resulted in his body being
                        heavily
                        damaged and requiring him to augment himself into a cyborg. Upon returning to Water 7, he became
                        the
                        leader of the Franky Family, a group of ship dismantlers and bounty hunters. Franky and his
                        followers were originally enemies of the Straw Hats at the beginning of the Water 7
                        Arc, until circumstances forced them to become allies at the end of the same arc and the Enies
                        Lobby
                        Arc. Franky's dream is to create a ship and circumnavigate the world with it, and he built the
                        Thousand Sunny and joined the Straw Hat Pirates to fulfill his dream.

                        Neptune

                        until severing ties with Big Mom during the Whole Cake Island Arc. After staying behind in Totto
                        Land to protect the Sun Pirates from Big Mom's wrath, Jinbe returned to the Straw Hats during

        <h2 class="title title-devil-fruits">Devil Fruit</h2>

        <p>
            Devil Fruits are mysterious, distinctive fruits scattered throughout the world, known for permanently
            granting their eaters superhuman powers and an equally permanent inability to swim. With only one notable
            exception, an individual can only acquire the powers of a single Devil Fruit and survive.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a whole, Devil Fruits encompass hundreds of different powers, from the (apparently) mundane to the
            inherently mass-destructive. These fruits are broadly grouped into three classes: Zoan, which allows a user
            to transform into an animal as well as an animal hybrid; Logia, which grants a user the power to create,
            control, and transform their body into a natural element; and Paramecia, which offers any of a vast array of
            strange abilities that do not fit into the other two categories.
        </p>

        <h3 class="title-list-fruits">
            Paramecia
        </h3>

        <p>
            The most common of the three Devil Fruit types, Paramecia-type Devil Fruits grant their users any one of a
            wide variety of superhuman powers; these powers include things like shock wave generation and locking onto
            targets. Paramecia Fruits can alter features of the user's body, granting them a slippery physique, a body
            of blades, or the ability to split their own body into pieces harmlessly. Some Paramecia Fruits allow the
            user to modify the people, objects, and environment around them by making things levitate or turning people
            into toys. Finally, some fruits exist that allow users to generate and manipulate substances, like wax or
            poison.
        </p>

        <p>
            The defining characteristic of Paramecia fruits is that the abilities they grant are anything other than the
            ability to transform into animals or change their body into natural elements like the fruits of the other
            two categories.

            Zoan
        </h3>

        <p>
            The users of Zoan-type Devil Fruits gain the ability to transform into a specific animal, as well as
            transform into a hybrid form that combines attributes of their own species and the species the fruit allows
            them to transform into. Unlike other Devil Fruits, Zoan-type fruits are said to have a will of their own. A
            recently discovered science allows Zoan Fruits to be integrated into inanimate objects, bringing the object
            to life and granting it the standard Zoan transformations.
        </p>

        <p>
            Zoan fruits greatly enhance the users physical abilities and are the best kind of power for augmenting melee
            combat. Carnivorous animal Zoans are better suited for combat due to their predatory attributes. Some Zoan
            even grant special abilities based on the animal, such as the king cobra Zoan allowing the user to spit
            globs of poison, or the mole Zoan allowing the user to dig through the earth, even through solid stone, at
            high speed.
        </p>

        <p>
            Aside from most Zoans that transform their users into animals that currently exist, there are three known
            sub-classifications:
        </p>

        <ul>

                    extinct species, such as dinosaurs.
                    Ancient Zoans are rare, and they appear to be stronger than regular Zoans. Some have even displayed
                    atypical physical abilities that their users claim the real animals naturally possess.
                </p>

                    mythological creatures, such as a dragon or a phoenix. Mythical Zoan animals tend to have additional
                    special powers, like a phoenix Zoan being able to generate flames that have healing powers. Mythical
                    Zoans are the rarest type of Devil Fruit, even more so than Logias.</p>

                    to permanently take on an animal characteristic; though, much more rarely, the user becomes able to
                    transform at will. The artificial Zoan Fruits had a 10% success rate, while the other 90%, in
                    addition to not gaining animal traits and losing the ability to swim, were stripped of the ability
                    to express negative emotions, leaving them only able to smile and laugh, regardless of how they
                    actually feel. These artificial Devil Fruits, known as SMILEs, were developed by Caesar Clown and
                    Donquixote Doflamingo. Another version was developed by Vegapunk

                SMILEs do not have individual names like the standard Devil Fruits, and are instead referred to as

        <p>
            The rarest and most powerful of the three Devil Fruit types, Logia-type Devil Fruits allow their users to
            create, control, and transform their body into a natural element, such as sand, mud, smoke, lightning, plant
            life, and even darkness. There are also Logias that can transform the user into artificial elements like
            paper or candy syrup, but these are considered non-canon.
        </p>

        <p>
            The elemental transformation effectively makes the user intangible, as well as allowing the user to remain
            in control of their body, even when it is broken into pieces. They also gain every ability related to that
            element, such as sand being able to absorb moisture or light being able to travel at light speed. The
            darkness element and its power of all consuming absorption has the unique ability to nullify any other Devil
            Fruit power upon contact with the user. Some Logia Devil Fruits even grant the user an infinite amount of
            space inside their elemental body.

        <p>
            The Marines are the World Government's military sea force, tasked with law enforcement, international
            security and military operations. They maintain a presence on all of the world's known seas, through
            countless branch offices; however, the vast majority of their assets are focused solely on the Grand Line,
            in which resides their main base of operations, Marine Headquarters. Collectively, they stand as one of the
            Three Great Powers, alongside the Four Emperors and the Seven Warlords of the Sea, who were later replaced
            by the SSG.

        <p>
            Due to their actions and role, they are one of the main antagonist groups of the series overall. They are
            the main antagonists of the Romance Dawn, Loguetown, Enies Lobby, Sabaody Archipelago, Marineford, and
            Return to Sabaody Arcs. They are also antagonists in various non-canon material, such as the Warship Island,
            Goat Island, G-8 and Marine Rookie filler Arcs, the fifth and eleventh movies, and the third, sixth and
            tenth specials.

            Duties
        </h3>

        <p>
            The duty of the Marines is to maintain a law and order throughout the world and impose the will and might of
            the World Government. The main purpose of the Marines is bringing any criminal to justice, with a particular
            focus on capturing pirates. They use justice as their constituted policy to manage a world that is made
            almost entirely of ocean much easier. They are generally divided between those who support Absolute Justice
            and those who support (generally more lax) personal justices, with the former being the code of conduct for
            the Marines as a central doctrine.
        </p>

        <p>
            Amongst their duties is awarding bounty hunters the bounties for the head of a criminal. They tolerate
            bounty hunters as a method of making their jobs easier, but are known to go out bounty hunting themselves.
            Apprehended criminals who are brought in alive are handed over to be made an example of. The Marines are
            left to ensure the transportation of these criminals to prison and/or to their execution.

            <p class="p-text">
                Sakazuki,formerly known by his admiral alias Akainu,is the current fleet admiral of the Marines,
                succeeding the previous fleet admiral, Sengoku. During the first half of the series, he was one of the
                three admirals, as the last one to debut. Upon becoming the fleet admiral, one of Sakazuki's first
                decisions was to relocate Marine Headquarters into the New World in preparation for the New Pirate Age.
                <br>
                In the manga, Akainu was first mentioned by Nico Robin during the initial encounter with Aokiji. In the
                anime, he was mentioned earlier by vice admiral Jonathan during the anime-only G-8 Arc, which aired
                after Akainu had been revealed in the manga.

            <p class="p-text">
                Borsalino, more commonly known by his alias Kizaru, is an admiral in the Marines. After Aokiji resigned
                from the Marines and Akainu was promoted to fleet admiral, Kizaru is now the only remaining admiral from
                the previous trio.
                <br>
                He was first mentioned by Nico Robin during the Straw Hats' initial encounter with Aokiji. Because of
                his actions, Kizaru can be considered the secondary antagonist of the Sabaody Archipelago Arc, one of
                the major antagonists of the Marineford Arc, and a supporting antagonist of the Egghead Arc.

                was responsible for overseeing Ace's birth and raising a young Luffy, before entrusting them both to the
                Dadan Family.
                <br>
                Garp is one of the major figures, along with Kong, Sengoku, Shiki, Silvers Rayleigh, Tsuru and
                Whitebeard, from the times when Gol D. Roger, the "Pirate King", was still alive. His feats as a Marine
                soldier were met with immense notoriety and prestige, with his actions during the God Valley Incident in
                particular bestowing him the title of Hero of the Marines. Notably, Garp was offered the rank of Admiral
                several times throughout his career, but he refused the offer of promotion every time.

                <br>
                He was formerly an involuntary pirate ship caretaker for the Alvida Pirates until he was liberated by

                it his mission to capture Luffy, and was later promoted to the rank of commodore, due to the events in
                Arabasta. At some point during the timeskip, he was promoted to the rank of vice admiral.Since his
                debut, he has been the superior of Tashigi, serving as her mentor as well.
                <br>
                He is a recurring adversary of Luffy. Due to his actions against Luffy at Loguetown, Smoker can be
                considered as the primary antagonist of the Loguetown Arc, and acts as a minor antagonist during the
                Marineford Arc. Despite his rivalry with Luffy, they ended up helping each other during the Arabasta
                Arc, and forming a temporary alliance during the Punk Hazard Arc, and the movie One Piece: Stampede.
                These temporary alliances only last long enough for the two groups to defeat their common enemies. As it
                typically goes between pirates and the Marines, they go back to being enemies again as soon as their
                common enemy is defeated in each of these story arcs.

        <h2 class="title-pirates ">Pirates</h2>

        <p>A pirate is, broadly speaking, any professional criminal that operates wholly or partially on the world's
            seas, especially people conducting robbery by ship. In most, if not all, cases they lead or belong to a
            group of like-minded criminals, known as a crew.</p>

        <p>Though not the only existing type of criminal, pirates appear to comprise most of the world's significant
            bounty heads, and with the possible exception of the Revolutionary Army constitute the strongest opposition
            to the authority of the World Government and Marines.</p>

            alt="Red Hair Pirates">

        <p class="p-info">Red Hair Pirates</p>

        <p>In the world of One Piece, perhaps the trait most universal to pirates, beside their sea-going activities and
            general defiance of the law, is the jolly roger: a skull-and-crossbones symbol meant for intimidation,
            usually flown on black flags at the top of the ships mast, as well as on the sails. The Jolly Roger has
            countless variants, every pirate group using their own unique design elements. The overall connotations of
            such a symbol is strong enough that the Marines have been known to attack ships flying it on sight, even if
            those onboard are not identified with any particular bounty or crime.</p>

        <p>Virtually all pirates exist as part of a pirate crew, comprising of other pirates willing to operate under
            the same Jolly Roger. A crew is typically led by a single Captain, who makes (or at least has final
            authority on) all major actions taken by the crew. The Captain often possesses the highest combat ability
            and notoriety out of anyone in the crew.</p>
